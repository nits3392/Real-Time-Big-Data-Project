1. Code filters the data first
2. Uses the filtered data to create a feature matrix.
3. Then 2 datasets are prepared and then scaled. 
a) Training data
b) Test Data

4. Evaluation matrix is defined that calculates the precision, accuracy etc.
5. Built the Decision Tree model and predictions were made on test data.

6. Built the Logistic Regression model and predictions were made on test data.
7. Built the SVM model and predictions were made on test data.

The predicton using the above models can be improved by integrating weather data in the traing dataset of the model. This will be the next step following 
which using sentimental analysis along with the prediction output for we will develop an airline rating model.
